**CS-221**
These are some coding examples that I did while in CS-221 Course with java.

**What I Learned**

Throughout the course of computer science 121 and 221 with java I learned:
1. Basic Syntax: Understanding the syntax of the Java programming language, including variables, data types, operators, and expressions.
2. Control Structures: Working with control structures such as if-else statements, loops (for, while, do-while), and switch statements for flow control in programs.
3. Methods: Defining and calling methods (functions) to encapsulate and reuse code blocks.
4. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Understanding the principles of OOP, including classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.
5. Arrays and Collections: Working with arrays and Java collections (ArrayList, LinkedList, etc.) to store and manipulate data.
6. Exception Handling: Handling errors and exceptions using try-catch blocks and understanding the concept of checked and unchecked exceptions.
7. File I/O: Reading from and writing to files using input/output streams and file handling classes.
8. Recursion: Understanding the concept of recursion and implementing recursive algorithms.
9. Sorting and Searching Algorithms: Implementing and understanding common sorting and searching algorithms such as bubble sort, selection sort, binary search, etc.
10. Graphical User Interfaces (GUI): Basic understanding of GUI programming using Java Swing or JavaFX for building graphical applications.
11. Data Structures: Introduction to basic data structures such as stacks, queues, linked lists, trees, and graphs, along with their implementations in Java.
